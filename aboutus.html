<h1>Who is CossiePlay?</h1>
    <p>
    CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and cost between $10 and $10,000.</p>

<p>Who’s Who
The CossiPlay family is:
Steven Rogers – Steve was a Navy Seal for 37 years before getting interested in hosting parties and helping people enyoj their fantasies together in a family-friendly fun environment.

Sally Rogers – After only 6 weeks of her first dress-making course, Sally was already designing and sewing elaborate ball gowns and costumes that amazed her instructors. 10 years later and she’s making even more amazing creations for happy customers.
